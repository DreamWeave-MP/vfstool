"""static/dreamweave/view.json: what only CI knows, for the templates.

The templates build every project page from mod.toml, mod.lock and the page itself
(templates/macros/project.html), so a plain `zola serve` renders the whole site. This adds what
needs git, the network or a build: the development release, tags that were never recorded, the
comments embed and the network page's checks. In offline mode (documentation inside archives) it
only says which version is being packaged: never git state, mod.lock or the clock.
